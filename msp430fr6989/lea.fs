\ LEA - Low Energy Accelerator
\ Module that is an execution unit for vector-based signal
\ processing operations.
\ Taken from the manual:
\ The LEA is a 32-bit hardware device designed for operations
\ that involve vector-based signal processing, such as 
\ FIR, IIR, and FFT without CPU intervention. The LEA supports multiple
\ commands, which are issued by CPU.

\ the LEA command set is broken up into multiple groups
\ This file is currently empty as it is a DSP in it's own right and uses 
\ interrupts to signal completion
